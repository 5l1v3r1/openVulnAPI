# Cisco PSIRT openVuln API

## Overview
The Cisco PSIRT openVuln API is a RESTful API that allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. It supports industrywide security standards such as the OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF), Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) identifiers, Common Weakness Enumerator (CWE), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

This API allows technical staff and programmers to build tools that help them do their job more effectively. In this case, it enables them to easily keep up with security vulnerability information specific to their network. That frees up more time for them to manage their network and deploy new capabilities in their infrastructure.

The API also allows Cisco customers and partners to leverage machine readable data to keep-up with Cisco security advisories. It further simplifies the evaluation process and reduces the time between when a vulnerability is announced and the fix is actually implemented.
